Cells.js
========

What is it?
-----------

Cells.js is a Javascript based "falling blocks" style game I wrote in 2008.
It's been tested this on IE8, Firefox 8, Chrome 16, and Safari 5 and was
pleasantly surprised to see it working.

Rather than let it collect dust on my hard disk, I've decided to share it
on github for distribution under the GNU General Public License.

Enjoy!

How to play
-----------

Simply cross your fingers, open cells.html in a browser, and click "Play!"

Click "Reset" to set the game back to it's initial state.

Enabling "Elimination Mode" check box prior to starting a game will prevent
blocks from clearing when they are completed. This forces you to try to get
the best score before the play area fills up.
